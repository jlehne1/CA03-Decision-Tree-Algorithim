# Notebook and Word File

This folder contains the fully functional notebook for assignment CA03 - Decision Tree Algorithms.  This folder also contains the assignment free response questions and the accompanying answers in a word file.

For data and templates used in the notebook, see the Data folder.

This assignment takes one through the process of constructing and implementing a decision tree algorithim.  Starting with data preparation and exploration, visualizations are created in order to best understand the binned census data that will be used in the model.  Next data is prepared for the model by splitting the test and train data and doing one-hot-encoding to make sure the model can handle the categorical variables.  Once the data is prepared, the decision tree model is run and code is run to visually show the decision tree.  The next step is to go through various combinations of hyperparameters in order to determine which set of hyperparameters returns the best model.  Finally, with the best model created one can use values created for a new individual to make a prediction as to the income categroy for that new individual.  With the best model being used, and accurate prediction can be made.

See inline comments in the notebook for further instructions about the code.
